<p>My career has been a series of ups and downs, starting out as a child
prodigy, getting involved in religious sectarianism which earned me a
life sentence, which I fortunately were able to circumvent, followed by
prestigious academic and diplomatic roles and finally by barely surviving being
shipwrecked.</p>
